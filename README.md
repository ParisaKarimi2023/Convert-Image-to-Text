# Convert-Image-to-Text

## Introduction

Image-to-text conversion—commonly known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR)—is the process of extracting written or printed text from images and converting it into machine-readable text.
This technology is widely used in applications such as document scanning, automated data entry, license plate recognition, and digital archiving.

The aim of this Python project is to design a system that can take an input image and accurately detect and extract text using OCR libraries such as Tesseract OCR, OpenCV, and Pillow.

## Objective
The main goals of the project are:
<ul>
<li>To build an automated Python tool that extracts text from images.</li>

<li>To preprocess images for higher OCR accuracy.</li>

<li>To use open-source libraries for image processing and text recognition.</li>

<li>To generate output in a readable text format (.txt).</li>
</ul>

## Libraries
<ul>
<li>Pytesseract – Python wrapper for Google Tesseract OCR</li>

<li>OpenCV (cv2) – Used for image preprocessing</li>

<li>Pillow (PIL) – Image loading and format support</li>

<li>NumPy – Numerical operations during preprocessing</li>
</ul>
